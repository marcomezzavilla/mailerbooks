            <h2>Infinite Jest</h2>
            <p class="author is-small">— David Foster Wallace</p>
            <div class="is-small _is-clamped description">
              <p>
                A gargantuan, mind-altering tragi-comedy about the Pursuit of
                Happiness in America.
              </p>
              <p>
                Set in an addicts' halfway house and a tennis academy, and
                featuring the most endearingly screwed-up family to come along
                in recent fiction, Infinite Jest explores essential questions
                about what entertainment is and why it has come to so dominate
                our lives; about how our desire for entertainment affects our
                need to connect with other people; and about what the pleasures
                we choose say about who we are.
              </p>
              <p>
                Equal parts philosophical quest and screwball comedy, Infinite
                Jest bends every rule of fiction without sacrificing for a
                moment its own entertainment value. It is an exuberant, uniquely
                American exploration of the passions that make us human—and one
                of those rare books that renew the idea of what a novel can do.

            <h2>The Invincible</h2>
            <p class="author is-small">— Stanislaw Lem</p>
            <div class="is-small _is-clamped description">
              <p>
                A space cruiser, in search of its sister ship, encounters beings
                descended from self-replicating machines.In the grand tradition
                of H. G. Wells and Jules Verne, Stanisław Lem's The Invincible
                tells the story of a space cruiser sent to an obscure planet to
                determine the fate of a sister spaceship whose communication
                with Earth has abruptly ceased. Landing on the planet Regis III,
                navigator Rohan and his crew discover a form of life that has
                apparently evolved from autonomous, self-replicating
                machines—perhaps the survivors of a “robot war.” Rohan and his
                men are forced to confront the classic quandary: what course of
                action can humanity take once it has reached the limits of its
                knowledge?
              </p>
              <p>
                In The Invincible, Lem has his characters confront the
                inexplicable and the bizarre: the problem that lies just beyond
                analytical reach.
