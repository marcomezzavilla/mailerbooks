                A gargantuan, mind-altering tragi-comedy about the Pursuit of
                Happiness in America.
              </p>
              <p>
                Set in an addicts' halfway house and a tennis academy, and
                featuring the most endearingly screwed-up family to come along
                in recent fiction, Infinite Jest explores essential questions
                about what entertainment is and why it has come to so dominate
                our lives; about how our desire for entertainment affects our
                need to connect with other people; and about what the pleasures
                we choose say about who we are.
              </p>
              <p>
                Equal parts philosophical quest and screwball comedy, Infinite
                Jest bends every rule of fiction without sacrificing for a
                moment its own entertainment value. It is an exuberant, uniquely
                American exploration of the passions that make us human—and one
                of those rare books that renew the idea of what a novel can do.

                A space cruiser, in search of its sister ship, encounters beings
                descended from self-replicating machines.In the grand tradition
                of H. G. Wells and Jules Verne, Stanisław Lem's The Invincible
                tells the story of a space cruiser sent to an obscure planet to
                determine the fate of a sister spaceship whose communication
                with Earth has abruptly ceased. Landing on the planet Regis III,
                navigator Rohan and his crew discover a form of life that has
                apparently evolved from autonomous, self-replicating
                machines—perhaps the survivors of a “robot war.” Rohan and his
                men are forced to confront the classic quandary: what course of
                action can humanity take once it has reached the limits of its
                knowledge?
              </p>
              <p>
                In The Invincible, Lem has his characters confront the
                inexplicable and the bizarre: the problem that lies just beyond
                analytical reach.

                The Star Rover is the story of San Quentin death-row inmate
                Darrell Standing, who escapes the horror of prison life—and long
                stretches in a straitjacket—by withdrawing into vivid dreams of
                past lives, including incarnations as a French nobleman and an
                Englishman in medieval Korea.
              </p>
              <p>
                Based on the life and imprisonment of Jack London’s friend Ed
                Morrell, this is one of the author’s most complex and original
                works. As Lorenzo Carcaterra argues in his Introduction, The
                Star Rover is “written with energy and force, brilliantly
                marching between the netherworlds of brutality and beauty.” This
                Modern Library Paperback Classic is set from the text of the
                first American edition, published in 1915.

                The underground masterpiece of twentieth-century Russian
                fiction, this classic novel was written during Stalin’s regime
                and could not be published until many years after its author’s
                death. When the devil arrives in 1930s Moscow, consorting with a
                retinue of odd associates—including a talking black cat, an
                assassin, and a beautiful naked witch—his antics wreak havoc
                among the literary elite of the world capital of atheism.
                Meanwhile, the Master, author of an unpublished novel about
                Jesus and Pontius Pilate, languishes in despair in a pyschiatric
                hospital, while his devoted lover, Margarita, decides to sell
                her soul to save him.
              </p>
              <p>
                As Bulgakov’s dazzlingly exuberant narrative weaves back and
                forth between Moscow and ancient Jerusalem, studded with scenes
                ranging from a giddy Satanic ball to the murder of Judas in
                Gethsemane, Margarita’s enduring love for the Master joins the
                strands of plot across space and time.

                When a mysterious figure appears in Three Pines one cold
                November day, Armand Gamache and the rest of the villagers are
                at first curious. Then wary. Through rain and sleet, the figure
                stands unmoving, staring ahead.
              </p>
              <p>
                From the moment the creature's shadow falls over the village,
                Gamache, now Chief Superintendent of the Sûreté du Quebec,
                suspects it has deep roots and a dark purpose. Yet he does
                nothing. What can he do? Only watch and wait. And hope his
                mounting fears are not realized.
              </p>
              <p>
                But when the figure vanishes overnight and a body is discovered,
                it falls to Gamache to discover if a debt has been paid or
                levied.
              </p>
              <p>
                Months later, on a steamy July day, as the trial for the accused
                begins in Montréal, Chief Superintendent Gamache continues to
                struggle with actions he set in motion that bitter November from
                which there is no going back. More than the accused is on trial.
                Gamache's own conscience is standing in judgment.
              </p>
              <p>
                In her latest utterly gripping book, number-one New York Times
                bestselling author Louise Penny shatters the conventions of the
                crime novel to explore what Gandhi called the court of
                conscience. A court that supersedes all others.

                Elias Canetti, winner of the 1981 Nobel Prize in Literature, was
                one of the major intellectual figures and polymaths of the
                twentieth century. A master of many genres, he is known
                especially for his novel, Auto da Fe, and his great work of
                social theory, Crowds and Power. But Canetti's genius is perhaps
                nowhere more evident than in the three volumes of his
                autobiography. This first volume, Tongue Set Free, provides a
                searching portrait of the author's personal background and
                creative development as it presents the events, personalities
                (especially Canetti's mother), and intellectual forces that
                shaped the growth of the artist as a young man.

                The Art of Looking Sideways is a primer in visual intelligence,
                an exploration of the workings of the eye, the hand, the brain
                and the imagination. It is an inexhaustible mine of anecdotes,
                quotations, images, curious facts and useless information,
                oddities, serious science, jokes and memories, all concerned
                with the interplay between the verbal and the visual, and the
                limitless resources of the human mind. Loosely arranged in 72
                chapters, all this material is presented in a wonderfully
                inventive series of pages that are themselves masterly
                demonstrations of the expressive use of type, space, color and
                imagery.

                This book does not set out to teach lessons, but it is full of
                wisdom and insight collected from all over the world. Describing
                himself as a visual jackdaw, master designer Alan Fletcher has
                distilled a lifetime of experience and reflection into a
                brilliantly witty and inimitable exploration of such subjects as
                perception, color, pattern, proportion, paradox, illusion,
                language, alphabets, words, letters, ideas, creativity, culture,
                style, aesthetics and value.

                Celebrate this milestone in the history of graphic novels,

                taking the prize in 1976 at the Angoulême Fesitval. Originally
                serialized beginning in 1967, this book is universally
                acknowledged as Hugo Pratt's masterpiece, in which he introduces
                Corto Maltese to the world.

                Corto is but one of a strong ensemble cast of characters whose
                lives permeate the entire 12-book series. It is here that we
                also meet the young and beautiful Pandora, her brother Cain, the
                mysterious criminal mastermind Monk, the grim and ferocious
                Rasputin, Lieutenant Slutter of the German Navy, and the natives
                Skull and Tarao. The Ballad of the Salty Sea is also hailed as
                the first example of the literary comic strip.

                Pratt was inspired by Conrad, Stevenson, and London, but even
                more directly by Henry de Vere Stacpool's Blue Lagoon, from
                which the author got the idea of a small island in the Pacific
                which he named "Escondida." The action begins in November 1913
                in the South Seas as feelings of the Great War were already
                looming but the romantic ideals of the nineteenth century were
                still alive. The pace of the narrative and the drawings are very
                modern and Pratt permeates the adventure with an extraordinary
                atmosphere of the great outdoors. The story captures the
                imagination of the reader from the opening pages with a tight,
                compelling storyline that can be interpreted on different
                levels.

                Down-and-out drunk Terry Lennox has a problem: his millionaire
                wife is dead and he needs to get out of LA fast. So he turns to
                the only friend he can trust: private investigator Philip
                Marlowe. Marlowe is willing to help a man down on his luck, but
                later Lennox commits suicide in Mexico and things start to turn
                nasty. Marlowe is drawn into a sordid crowd of adulterers and
                alcoholics in LA's Idle Valley, where the rich are suffering one
                big suntanned hangover. Marlowe is sure Lennox didn't kill his
                wife, but how many stiffs will turn up before he gets to the
                truth?
